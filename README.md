# API-Encryption-Library
API Encryption Library is a Python-based library designed to secure API requests and responses by encrypting sensitive data.
    The script is designed to provide robust encryption and security measures for API requests and responses, in order to protect sensitive data from attackers.

    The script uses well-established cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL and follows standards such as NIST and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 to ensure that the encryption algorithms and key management procedures are strong and secure.

    The script implements a number of security measures, including using a secure key derivation function, random initialization vectors, message authentication codes, forward secrecy, HTTPS encryption, and rate limiting, to prevent various types of attacks such as data interception, modification, and denial of service.

    The script includes a menu system similar to Metasploit, with an ASCII art banner that reads "D0G by TADASH10", to provide a user-friendly interface for selecting and running different encryption and decryption options.

    The script is written in Python, a widely used language in the cybersecurity industry, and can be easily integrated into existing API systems.
    
        First, download and install the API Encryption Library on your local machine.
    Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the API Encryption Library is installed.
    To encrypt an API request or response, use the following command:

php

python3 api_encrypt.py -m "request" -k <encryption_key> -i <initialization_vector> -a <authentication_key> -u <api_url>

    -m specifies whether the message to be encrypted is a "request" or "response".
    -k specifies the encryption key to be used.
    -i specifies the initialization vector to be used.
    -a specifies the authentication key to be used.
    -u specifies the API URL to be encrypted.

    To decrypt an API request or response, use the following command:

php

python3 api_decrypt.py -m "request" -k <encryption_key> -i <initialization_vector> -a <authentication_key> -u <api_url>

    -m specifies whether the message to be decrypted is a "request" or "response".
    -k specifies the encryption key to be used.
    -i specifies the initialization vector to be used.
    -a specifies the authentication key to be used.
    -u specifies the encrypted API URL to be decrypted.

    To generate a random encryption key, initialization vector, and authentication key, use the following command:

python3 key_gen.py

    For additional options and parameters, use the --help command:

python

python3 api_encrypt.py --help
python3 api_decrypt.py --help
python3 key_gen.py --help

That's it! You should now be able to use the API Encryption Library through the CLI in bash. Remember to follow best practices for key management and encryption to ensure the security of your API requests and responses.
